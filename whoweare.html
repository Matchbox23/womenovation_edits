                                            The organization’s primary aim is to invest in supporting design-based industries in generating economic opportunities for women.
                                            Our second organizational aim is to strengthen the culture of gender equality across society.

                                            Given the low participation of women in the economy,
                                            effectively supporting design-based industries and providing women with entrepreneurship opportunities and decent jobs
                                            translate to economic growth and an accelerated progress in the achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs).
                                            Raising awareness on the importance of women’s equal rights and their ability to equally perform and deliver is a
                                            crucial factor to ensure all citizens become proactive in reducing gender disparities.

                                                While analyzing data about women,  Walid Osman, Womenovation’s Founder,
                                                noticed that 75% of Egyptian women eligible to work are inactive in the economy
                                                and concluded that these women are either working informally or living as dependents.
                                                His childhood interest in art and design sparked the idea of engaging those women
                                                in elevating the design industry while elevating their economic status.

                                                After a period of research and drafting ideas, Osman developed an initial concept note titled
                                                “The Womenovation Initiative,” which he designed as a set of activities aiming to build the
                                                capacities of women with artistic talents and provide them with opportunities in the most relevant industries.
                                                Over the past few years, the National Council for Women (NCW) has achieved significant progress in the framework
                                                of women's empowerment. Consequently, the concept note was shared with NCW, the national institution responsible
                                                for ensuring women and men are equal in terms of their economic, political, and legislative rights.

                                                By overseeing the opportunity in the initial concept note,
                                                NCW supported the concept suggesting its execution in an institutionalized approach
                                                operating independently under a civil society framework. Moreover, NCW believed in the
                                                importance of recognizing the efforts of the concept developer, which led to Womenovation’s
                                                evolution into a Foundation. On Gender Day of COP 27, Womenovation’s Founder Walid Osman publicly
                                                presented an overview of Womenovation’s institutional framework and scope for the first time.

                                                expand its network, and submit proposals to donors. In July 2023, Womenovation received its first
