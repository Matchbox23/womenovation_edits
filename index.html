                <p class="text">
                    The Womenovation Foundation was launched in November 2022 during
                    COP27’s Gender Day in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The Foundation’s
                    concept emerged with an aim to accelerate sustainable development
                    through growing the economy by providing more economic opportunities
                    for women and effectively promoting the innovative outputs created.
                    Our strategy believes in the power of advocacy and effective
                    utilization of media, culture, arts, and innovation to promote an
                    innovative culture believing in gender equality.
                    <br /><br />
                    Our targets are coherent to the United Nations’ global Sustainable
                    Development Goals (SDGs). However, due to the broad nature of SDGs,
                    we rely on evidence-based research that identify community
                    challenges and an in-depth overview of local needs. Research results
                    assist us in setting priorities and delivering projects with
                    stronger impact. We are currently active through our projects are
                    based in Egypt as an initial steppingstone towards future expansion
                    in Africa and the Middle East.

                    The power of Egyptian art has always been globally recognized due to its ancient history starting with pharaonic art, the core inspiration for the globally admired and timeless "art deco".
                    Wherever we are, the first image that comes to anyone’s mind when we say Egypt is either the Pyramids, Abu Simbel, coptic churches or the minarets of Islamic Cairo… its all art.
                    <br /><br />
                    The slow down of economic growth as a result of the invasion of Ukraine following a global crisis of a pandemic constitutes a global challenge. Egypt is no exception from this global economic trend, which is reflected in a more challenging journey towards sustainable development goals (SDGs). Economic challenges have impacted every household,
                    but it is essential to realize the opportunity of the current economic crisis.
                    The dropped Egyptian Pound constitutes an opportunity for global competitiveness, industrial development, boosting exports and reducing unemployment.
                    <br /><br />
                    Furthermore, statistics from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) indicate that women who are not working could increase the economy by 34% if they join the national labor force.
                    Just in time, the Womenovation Foundation emerges to create more opportunities for women, support the Egyptian design industry through sustainable production,
                    investor relations, marketing strategies and knowledge sharing which would all contribute to Egypt’s ability to increase its share in global markets and reduce female unemployment.
                    <br /><br />
                    In my personal view, an existence of fascinating Egyptian designs in the global market is a necessity that will compliment the legendary artistic heritage we have which I consider Egypt’s soft power.

        <p class="text">
            Sustainable development without effective advocacy and awareness is
            inevitable. Most Development cooperation projects constantly lose
            opportunities of impact optimization due to their limited focus on
            citizen engagement, advocacy, and communication. Our existence is
            driven by an aim to fill this gap through integrating fine and
            applied arts in sustainable development. We design programs based on
            bottom-up and top-down approaches depending on the development
            objectives. The Foundation’s approach is based on partnerships and
            community collaborations motivated to utilize artistic tools to
            positively engage communities in sustainable development.

            Egyptian art has been the most powerful globally due to its ancient history starting with paharaonic art, the core inspiration for the globally admired and timeless artdeco.
            The first image that comes to anyone across the globe when you say Egypt is either the Pyramids, Abu Simbel, coptic churches or the minarettes of Islamic Cairo… it’s all art.
            <br /><br />
            Economic growth has been slowing down across the world as a result of the invasion of Ukraine following a global crisis of C pandemic. Egypt was no exception from the global trend of reduced investments, rocketing inflation and higher interest rates. The recent currency devaluation impacted every household,  but the opportuniy behind this devaluation is not even partially optimized.
            The dropped Egyptian Pound constitutes an opportunity for global competitiveness, industrial development, boosting exports and reducing unemployment.
            <br /><br />
            Furthermore, statistics from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) indicate that women who are not working could increase the economy by 34% if they join the national laborforce.
            Just in time, Womenovation Foundation emerges to create more opportunities for women, support the Egyptian design insdustry through sustainable production, investor relations, marketing strategies and knowledge sharing which would all contribute to Egypt’s ability to increase its share in global markets and reduce female unemployment.
            <br /><br />
            In my personal view, an existence of fascinating Egyptian designs in the global market is a necessetiy to compliment the legendary artistic heritage we have which I consider Egypt’s soft power.
